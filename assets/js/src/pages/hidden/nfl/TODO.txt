- adding camera movement so the camera follows animations / zooms to the players upper body etc
- stitching some animations together
- blending between animations so that the transition from e.g. idle to throw is smooth
- adding a couple of other animations (victory and mirroring catch at least)
- assigning animations to the correct attributes
- designing the final app for the writer and for the reader
