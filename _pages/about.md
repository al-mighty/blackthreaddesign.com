Hello, and welcome to my website! My name's Lewy, I'm a Irish front end JavaScript expert specializing in WebGL with three.js. Have a look around the site for examples of my recent [work](/work/), [experiments](/experiments/) and my series of tutorials on [getting up and running with three.js](/tutorials/). 

If you like what you see drop me a line, I'd love to hear from you! I currently mainly work through [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~0138561bc4900bdef8/), however I'm open to any proposals here too, so if you have a proposal get in touch.
