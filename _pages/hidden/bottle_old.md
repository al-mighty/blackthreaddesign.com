This is a recreation of your current scene with improved materials and controls, and smoother rotation. I've also updated the resizing setup and added a statistics overlay for testing. 

Performance should be nearly the same as your current setup, although the materials are a little more expensive than the ones you were previously using and there is one additional light.

I've also added an environment map, which you can see [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/dev/examples/textures/2294472375_24a3b8ef46_o.jpg). It's free to use, and looks pretty good, however if you prefer we can look for one that shows the inside of a bar (or wherever your preferred beer drinking location is).
