This is the new model - you can see the extra detail in the cap and glass if you look closely. 
But... the export from Blender has not gone completely smoothly, resulting in this cool faceted look. 

I've disabled the label and the beer inside for now so that you can see the problem more clearly. 

I'll have to take the model back into Blender and fix it, which shouldn't be too hard but will take some experimentation to get right (basically, trying something, re-exporting, loading it here again, trying something else if that doesn't work etc. etc.). These kind of issues are unfortunately pretty common issue when importing models from 3D applications onto the web, it's far from an exact science! 

Aside from this issue though, the new model looks good, and at first glance it looks like performance should actually be pretty similar to your current model.
