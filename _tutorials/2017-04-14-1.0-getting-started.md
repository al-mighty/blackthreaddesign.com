Welcome to the tutorial series on three.js. In this first tutorial we'll cover the simplest possible method of getting three.js to display something in your browser. 

We'll be creating this:

TODO: include example

First, create a directory to hold these tutorials. I'll be assuming that you have put them in `C:/tutorials` for simplicity. So, create `C:/tutorials/first-steps/1.0/getting-started.html` containing:

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1" />

    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />

    <title>Simple three.js scene</title>
  </head>

  <body>

  </body>

</html> 
{% endhighlight %}

The only interesting thing here is the `    <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1" />`. This prevents lots of problems with scaling on mobile devices and you should always include it in your three.js apps if possible. 

Next, we'll include the latest version of three.js:

{% highlight html %}
...

  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1" />

    <script src="https://threejs.org/build/three.js"></script>

    <title>Simple three.js scene</title>
  </head>

...
{% endhighlight %}

Note that we are including the unminified version of the three.js file. This is useful in development as we will get more meaningful error messages. In a production environment you would want to change this to `three.min.js` though. Also, we are loading the file from [threejs.org](threejs.org), which is not a [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network). In a production environment you would at least want to load the file using:

{% highlight html %}
...
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/84/three.min.js"></script>
...
{% endhighlight %}

However in later tutorials we'll be going over how to bundle all our Javascript into a single file and compressing that to minimize page load time, so this will do for the time being. 

Now if you open your `index.html` file in your favourite browser ( Chrome or Firefox are strongly reccomended for development work), you will just see a white screen. However if you open the developer console ( `ctrl + shift + I` windows / linux, `Cmd + Opt + I` mac ), then type `THREE` and press return you should see

{% highlight js %}
Object { WebGLRenderTargetCube: WebGLRenderTargetCube(), WebGLRenderTarget: WebGLRenderTarget(), WebGLRenderer: WebGLRenderer(), ShaderLib: Object, UniformsLib: Object, UniformsUtils: Object, ShaderChunk: Object, FogExp2: FogExp2(), Fog: Fog(), Scene: Scene(), 367 moreâ€¦ }
{% endhighlight %}

telling us that the `THREE` global variable has loaded and can be used. 

Somewhere after the `<script>` tag loading three.js we'll create another (empty) script tag to create our example application. Here we will include it inside the `<body>` tag, although that is not necessary. 

{% highlight html %}
...
<body>
  <script>

    // our code will go here

  </script>
</body>
...
{% endhighlight %}

We'll also add some very simple styling to the body. Put it inside the `<head>` tag:

{% highlight html %}
...

  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1" />
    
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />

    <script src="https://threejs.org/build/three.js"></script>

    <style>
      body {
        background-color: #000000;
        margin: 0px;
        overflow: hidden;
      }
    </style>

    <title>Simple three.js scene</title>
  </head>

...
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, we can start writing our app inside that empty `<script>` tag. First we'll set up the renderer. 

{% highlight html %}
...
<body>
  <script>

    var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
    renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
    document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

  </script>
</body>
...
{% endhighlight %}

Here we have created a [`THREE.WebGLRenderer()`](http://threejs.dev/docs/#api/renderers/WebGLRenderer).
