At the moment our scene is not interactive. We'll add some simple controls in the form the `OrbitalControls`. This is the first thing that we want to use that is not part of the three.js core. That is, it is not included in the main `three.js` JavaScript file that we've been loading so far. Instead, it's in a seperate file located at [/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js) in the three.js Github repository. 

There are lots of other "examples" (or rather, plugins) contained here, and we'll go over how to use them later. But for now, let's add these controls to our scene as a quick example of how to use these plugins.
