## Asking for help
So, you are completely stuck and you need help? Well, there are plenty of places around where you can find people to help you with all aspects of programming, web development, WebGL and three.js. You can figure out the best places to ask about the first three yourself, but for three.js these are good places to start.

But first, remember that whenever you are asking for programming help you are much more likely to receive it if you write up your question clearly and always, always *provide a complete code snippet* that you are having trouble with. Ideally create a  Codepen or Jsfiddle illustrating your problem that way someone can just modify your code to show you the best way to solve your issue - and speaking for myself, at least half the time if I need to ask for help, by the time I've finished coding a simplified example of the problem to show people, I've already figured it out. 

Here are some templates to get you started:

* [three.js codepen template](http://codepen.io/looeee/pen/PpEyJv) (latest release branch)
* [three.js codepen template](http://codepen.io/looeee/pen/OpzBxe) (dev branch)
* [three.js jsfiddle template](http://jsfiddle.net/akmcv7Lh/) (latest release branch)
* [three.js jsfiddle template](http://jsfiddle.net/hw9rcLL8/) (dev branch)

Note the inclusion of the dev(elopment) branches - three.js has a very fast bug zapping process and in particular if you think you have found a bug, try it out on the dev branch, as it may already have been fixed. 


### Three.js on Stack Overflow
Traditionally, Stack Overflow has been the place to ask three.js related questions, and it is still the best first place to check. You can see a list of all the question tagged with `three.js` [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/three.js?sort=votes), and if you click the <i class="fa fa-fw fa-search"></i> icon on that page, it will allow you to search through all these answers. Be warned that because of the rapid three.js development cycle, older answers may have outdated information. 

### The official three.js forum
If you can't find a solution there, you can ask a new question, or you can use the shiny new (just a couple of weeks old as I write this) official three.js [forum](https://discourse.threejs.org/) (*author disclaimer:* I'm a moderator on this forum). Stack Overflow has quite formal requirements for asking questions, and while it is still the best place to ask coding questions, if you just don't quite understand something that has already been asked, or even just want to show of your work or connect with the three.js community, the forum is the place to go. 

### The three.js subreddit
It's not particularly active, and is more used as a showcase than a help site, but you can also try your luck with the [three.js subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/threejs/).

## Reporting a bug 
If you think you have found a bug, a mistake in the docs, or you have a suggestion for something new that you would like added to the library, then you can raise and issue on [github](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues). 
But please please try and find the solution yourself first, make sure that it is actually a bug and not just a mistake in your code, and don't ask help questions here. Three.js is coded completely on a voluntary basis and their workload is already high without having to sort through a load of help requests while trying to fix bugs and improve the library.
