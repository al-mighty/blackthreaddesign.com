So what do we need to get a three.js scene running anyway? Well, in this tutorial series, we are going to be focussing on the [WebGLRenderer](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/renderers/WebGLRenderer), which, as the name implies, requires a [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) enabled device. Not so long ago, this was something that we had to worry about - fortunately for us though, those days have largely passed. We'll use two main sources for this claim, firstly the ubiquitous [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/#search=WebGL), which reports a global rate of 91.86% WebGL enabled devices, and secondly [webglstats.com](http://webglstats.com/) which reports a slightly higher 96%.

Bear in mind that although <92% might seem low, the majority of users that you will be targeting with a flashy 3D web app likely don't fall into the remaining 8% anyway, although you should definitely do some research (and certainly check the localized stats on caniuse.com if you are targeting a particular country or demographic).

If you are worried about users without WebGL, check out the docs page [WebGL Compatibility Check](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/introduction/WebGL-compatibility-check) for a method of testing and providing a fallback - in that example, the fallback is just warning displayed to the user, however you could also try switching to one of the other [renderers](/tutorials/8.5-plugins-renderers).
